                        I have a background in Fashion Design and Retail
                        Management and over 6 years experience working with a
                        range of products. I am great at developing branding and
                        have a track record working with generational insights,
                        collecting and considering trend and consumer led data,
                        and with these skills, I create design that truly
                        reflects the business needs.

                        others and impacts not just peoples lives, but also the
                        climate positively.
