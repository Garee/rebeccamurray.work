                        I&#39;m Rebecca (She/Her) and I am a UX/UI Designer
                        based in Glasgow
                    </h3>
                    <p className={styles.aboutInfo}>
                        Originally from the Outer Hebrides, I am a UX/UI
                        designer with a background in fashion design and retail
                        management. I have over 6 years experience working with
                        a variety of high end textile products, from kids bags
                        to wedding dresses. I recently completed the UI Design
                        course with CareerFoundry in January 2023.

                        What I value most are brands that push the boat out,
                        delivering quality products with a positive social
                        impact. I value research, which is essential to
                        delivering a smooth enjoyable user experience that is
                        functional and beautiful. Pretty and trendy designs are
                        great, but it can be rendered useless if the research is
                        missing, and it doesnâ€™t work.
